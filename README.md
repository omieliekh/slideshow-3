#Flashcards Slidemaker

This application allows you to build simple slideshows and view them.

## INSTALLATION

### Do only once: 
* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (This is must-have, since we using node for server-side and build tools)
* Run `npm install -g grunt` (this will install `grunt` package globally)

### Do each time you pull new changes:
* Run `npm install`

### Do each time when you start development:
* Run `grunt` (this will compile less to css, run local server and run watcher)
* You don't need to do anything else except coding, watcher will compile css and restart server automatically on respective file changes
